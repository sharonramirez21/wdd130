                <h2>History</h1>
                <h3>Founding (2005):
                    Splash White Water Rafting was founded by a group of rafting enthusiasts and nature lovers who shared a vision: to provide adventure experiences in white water while promoting safety and environmental conservation. They started with a small fleet of rafts and a strong commitment to quality and customer care.
                    
                    Initial Growth (2006-2010):
                    The early years were marked by steady growth. Thanks to the passion of their guides and word-of-mouth from satisfied customers, Splash gained a reputation in the adventure sports community. The company expanded its routes and began offering customized excursions, attracting families and groups.
                    
                    Recognition and Expansion (2011-2015):
                    As Splash’s popularity grew, so did its reputation. The company received several local awards for its commitment to safety and sustainability. New activities, such as rafting classes and educational tours, were introduced, further diversifying their offerings.
                    
                    Community Commitment (2016-2020):
                    Splash White Water Rafting focused on strengthening its connection with the local community. Conservation programs were implemented, and river clean-up events were organized. Collaborations with environmental organizations were established to educate visitors on the importance of protecting ecosystems.
                    
                    Present Day (2023):
                    Today, Splash White Water Rafting is a leader in adventure ecotourism. With a team of highly trained guides and an unwavering commitment to safety and the environment, the company continues to offer thrilling experiences that leave a lasting impression on every visitor. Splash’s mission remains the same: to provide unforgettable adventures while protecting nature.
